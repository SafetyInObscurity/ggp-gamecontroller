This has been modified from the OPAnytimeHyperPlayer class to read the probability distribution for the opponent's moves
from the logs the cheat player made on the last move
e.x. stepnum -1

This is an attempt to show that KNOWING the distribution will improve play over uniform by using the actual distribution
the cheat player used to choose a move
